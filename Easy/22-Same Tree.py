# Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
# Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

        return (p.val == q.val) and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
